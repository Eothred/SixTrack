The python script elens_plot_kick.py plots the kick received from the elens. In total 4 elenses are inserted to check 4 different cases:
1) hel1: no offset
2) hel2: offset x, offset y
3) hel3: offset x, no offset y
4) hel4: no offset x, offset y
The particle coordinates are dumped before and after the 4 elenses in the files HEL_DUMP_*. The kick given by the elens is then just the difference between the particle coordinates after and before the elens.

For the case 'ANNULAR' the elens should only x',y'. The script checks that x,y are unchanged (rrin-rrout=0) and then plots the difference in (x'**2+y'**2). The maximum kick given should be thetamax indicated by a black line. As the offset is subtracted from x,y, the kick needs to look the same for all 4 cases (see kick.png).
