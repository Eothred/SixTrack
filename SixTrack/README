  SixTrack Version: 4.2.4 Revision 1.31/1.32 adriana
    C. Bracco / A. Rossi / Th. Weiler
    Changes in the collimation part:
    -- Added and updated alignment errors (tilt, offset,
       gap-size): all values of alignment errors can be kept
       identical for different runs, by applying the same seed.
       Therefore the random function myran_gauss and rndm5 have
       been added and the inputs fort.3 adapted.
    -- Alignment errors are also applied for deformed jaws.
    -- Added to the pencil beam section the possibility to
       generate different particle distributions (Gaussian and
       rectangular in x and y) on the selected collimator.
    -- Changes to the do_select option to get the multi-turn
       halo information for all particle packets.
    C. Bracco / A. Rossi / Th. Weiler

  SixTrack Version: 4.2.3 Revision 1.30 frs
    -- Fix the missing phase advance in the solenoid. This thin element is 
       special in the sense that the it creates a direct phase advance that 
       has to be calculated at every element occurrence. Fix the missing 
       phase advance in the solenoid. This thin element is special in the 
       sense that the it creates a direct phase advance that has to be
       calculated at every element occurrence.
  Frank Schmidt 27th July, 2009

  SixTrack Version: 4.2.2 Revision 1.29 yipeng
    -- First attempt at thin solenoid (work done by Yipeng Sun)
       The tune calculation in the traditional SixTrack part seems slightly off.
       DA part seems okay and in agreement with MAD-X.
  Yipeng Sun & Frank Schmidt 24th July, 2009

    -- Implemented additional debug dump routines (needs testing)
    -- Remove n_cut=0 and n_nocut=0 (wrongly added by me)

    -- Fixed the SixTwiss output to write one line F20.13
       and most importantly changed the bnlrec count for C/R
   McIntosh 2nd September, 2008

  SixTrack Version: 4.1.11 CVS Version 1.21 McIntosh
    -- make_six copies only necessary .ast and .f files
       Sorted .f files for crlibm for windows and makes a
       link from the new executable to SixTrack
    -- SixTrack for BNL only, use fort.54 for beambeamdist.dat for
       BOINC and CPSS. Use fort.52, fort.53, fort.51 and fort.97
       for beambeam-output.dat, beambeam-lostID.dat, SixTwiss.dat,
       and checkdist.dat for CPSS but ONLY fort.10 for BOINC.

    -- Added C/R for synuthck, 6d thick lens and variable IL.
       Modified crpoint,crcheck, and crstart and the size of the C/R file.
    -- If bnlelens, use napx rather napx00/npart for number of pairs
    -- Most important is that bnlens option is now an addition to the
       normal tracking so that the SAME executable can be used for
       normal DA and bnlelens LHC=9 runs (important for BOINC/CPSS)
       but LHC=9 does NOT write binary files nor post-process.
  McIntosh 20th August, 2008

  SixTrack Version: 4.1.7 CVS Version 1.17 McIntosh
    -- make_six has a new 'debug' option to aid SixTrack development.
    -- If debug is selected, a new flag to ASTUTE SixTrack makes 
       available Unit 99 for messages and dumps and a set of dump 
       routines (of which only a full dump in this version).
    -- A  couple of write(* in SUBRE are now handled by C/R.
    -- A couple of bugs with C/R and IDFOR have been fixed.
    -- All subsequent changes noted here are for the 'bnlelens'
       and other SixTrack functionality should be unchanged
       (except that fort.95 and 96 are used for Checkpoint/Restart,
       C/R, instead of 12 and 13.)
    -- The bnlelens option has been implemented in comdecks bnlin and
       bnlout principally so it works for all six tracking routines.
       This has been tested only for THCK6D so far.
       There are now no changes to trauthck and trauthin.
    -- The C/R option for 6d and thick lens is disabled unless
       debug is selected.
    -- C/R now handles additional variables and correctly positions
       the beambeam-output.dat and beambeam-lostID.dat files.
    -- The binary files 90-59 are not used; no post-processing is
       performed. All OPEN/CLOSE have been moved to the standard comdecks
       and the variables moved to COMMON initialised by COMNUL.
    -- The READDIS routine for bnlelens is renamed to BNLRDIS to
       avoid confusion with collimation and it uses UNIT 54 to 
       read beambeamdist.dat which may now have only one sample.
    -- The n_cut and n_nocut variables are set to zero before the j loop.
  McIntosh 18th August, 2008

  SixTrack Version: 4.1.6 CVS Version 1.16 McIntosh
     -- and of course I forgot the SixTrack Version....
     -- Version and moddate set to 4.1.6, I am
        skipping 4.1.4 and 4.1.5 and then CVS and SixTrack versions 
        should correspond. Otherwise we get confused.
  McIntosh 5th August, 2008

  SixTrack Version: 4.1.3 CVS Version 1.15 McIntosh
     -- Second interim update for BNL.

     -- Patched make_six mkwindows to sort out logsix.c and .h
        until we can sort out CVS
     -- Under +if bnlelens set ch1 to "" in subroutine intepr
     -- Under +if bnlelens replaced  rvv(j)= by rvv(i)= in trauthck
     -- Under +if bnlelens added k=0 before 1st linopt call to writelin
   McIntosh 5th August, 2008

  SixTrack Version: 4.1.3 CVS Version 1.14 McIntosh
     -- First interim update to facilitate development with BNL.
     -- make_six creates a directory and executable name based on options.
     -- make_six now supports [+-]bignblz which sets nblz to 200,000!!! if selected.
     -- The Makefile creates a map and uses -g in FC for NAG.
     -- crlibm is cleaned up for Linux/Windows and logsix.dat and logsix.h are used
        instead of log.c and log.h and inlining is handled with an IFDEF.
     -- In bnlelens Unit 97 (not 98) is used for checkdist.dat.
     -- A problem with open(10... and open(99 is fixed for NAG.

        Version is an 8 character string [v]v.[v]v.[v]v and
        moddate a 10 character string dd.mm.yyyy. The version is
        stored in floating-point in sumda(52) for BOINC in particular.
        In this way fort.10 identifies the version which produced it.
     -- Small format changes to a couple of comments and the SIXDA
        date/time corrected.

   Cernlib and Naglib.
   Options are: tilt tracking fast crlibm windows cernlib naglib da collimat cpss boinc cr nag g77
   Defaults are: tilt tracking fast crlibm cernlib naglib
   -option to delete it e.g -cernlib
   [+]option to activate e.g +cr for Checkpoint/Restart

   Uses the ast files in ast_mask
   e.g.
   make_six (defaults to tracking tilt fast crlibm cernlib)
   make_six collimat (does the same but with collimation)
   Supported compilers are lf95 (default) or NAG f95 or g77.
   Fixed a bug with crbinrecs in writebin in sixtrack.s

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.0
   Comments: Includes beam collimation, checkpoint/restart, and
             crlib options along with major code cleanup.

   Options: The following sub-directories, 
            ast_crcrlib ast_crlib ast_straight ast_tilt,
            contain the .ast files for building as follows:
            The straight/tilt builds without/with tilt.
            The crcrlib builds tilt with checkpoint/restart and crlib.
            The crlib builds tilt with crlib.
  
   Default: The .ast files in the current directory are for ast_crlib
            on SLC3 Linux at CERN. The crlibm routines in CRLIBOBJS.a
            are for Linux and have been compiled with lf95 6.2 and gcc 3.2.3.

   The following options are available (after copying the desired ast files
   to the current directory if non-default):

   makex clean

   makex sixtrack_vector_new

   makex sixtrack_da_new
