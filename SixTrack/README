  SixTrack Version: 4.0.03
   Completely new make_six to make SixTrack,(default), SixTrack_da (da) with crlibm/crlibm.a,
   Cernlib and Naglib.
   Options are: tilt tracking fast crlibm windows cernlib naglib da collimat cpss boinc cr nag g77
   Defaults are: tilt tracking fast crlibm cernlib naglib
   -option to delete it e.g -cernlib
   [+]option to activate e.g +cr for Checkpoint/Restart

   Uses the ast files in ast_mask
   e.g.
   make_six (defaults to tracking tilt fast crlibm cernlib)
   make_six collimat (does the same but with collimation)
   Supported compilers are lf95 (default) or NAG f95 or g77.
   Fixed a bug with crbinrecs in writebin in sixtrack.s

  SixTrack Version: 4.0.0
   Comments: Includes beam collimation, checkpoint/restart, and
             crlib options along with major code cleanup.

   Options: The following sub-directories, 
            ast_crcrlib ast_crlib ast_straight ast_tilt,
            contain the .ast files for building as follows:
            The straight/tilt builds without/with tilt.
            The crcrlib builds tilt with checkpoint/restart and crlib.
            The crlib builds tilt with crlib.
  
   Default: The .ast files in the current directory are for ast_crlib
            on SLC3 Linux at CERN. The crlibm routines in CRLIBOBJS.a
            are for Linux and have been compiled with lf95 6.2 and gcc 3.2.3.

   The following options are available (after copying the desired ast files
   to the current directory if non-default):

   makex clean

   makex sixtrack_vector_new

   makex sixtrack_da_new
